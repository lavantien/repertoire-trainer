# Repertoire Trainer

This is a program that helps beginners practice Chess more efficiently, based on the concept of flashcards.

You input your own repertoire, and the program will prompt you random opening/endgame for you to play out.

Then, you can examine the result in details as well as see your accuracy history overtime.
